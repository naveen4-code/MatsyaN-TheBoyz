MatsyaN - THE BOYZ | Geo-Tagged Fish Catch Logger
A smart, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) for fishermen to log, store, and analyze their fish catches using AI and geolocation â€” even in areas with no internet access. Integrated with Google Gemini AI for fish species recognition and Firebase Cloud for authentication and storage.

Problem Statement:
Fishermen often lack a streamlined way to log catches detailing species, weight, time, and GPS location. This leads to:
- Lost or inaccurate data
- No historical insights for personal tracking or marine research
- Incompatibility with offline coastal or marine conditions

MatsyaN solves this with:
- AI-powered image-based fish recognition
- Offline-first logging with automatic sync
- Geo-tagging via Leaflet + OpenStreetMap
- Simple PWA interface for use even on mobile phones
